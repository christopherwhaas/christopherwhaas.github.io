- Adapted and zonally isolated the existing NLB deletion logic to mitigate risks during rollout while also expediting delivery in order to meet a critical customer deadline for a highly anticipated feature allowing users to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/02/aws-network-load-balancer-removing-availability-zones/" target="_blank">remove availability zones from existing NLBs</a> ultimately enabling customers to reduce their operational costs and overhead of maintaining unused resources. 
- Transformed an existing beta feature’s design and was the team’s sole developer of an automated workflow for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/capacity-unit-reservation.html" target="_blank">NLB on-demand capacity reservation</a>, allowing enterprise customers to preemptively secure network bandwidth for high-traffic events. Worked closely with internal dependency services to iterate through the various constraints of handling large provisioning orders and escalated key design changes to product management to craft a viable customer experience ahead of the official launch at AWS Re:Invent conference 2024.
- Led the design and was the team’s sole implementer of AWS Route 53’s ARC <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/cross-zone-network-load-balancer-zonal-shift-autoshift/" target="_blank">Zonal Shift integration for NLBs</a>, enabling seamless traffic redirection by availability zone—adopted by over 500K NLBs. Coordinated with five teams to deliver a rollout plan involving a backfill and migration of hundreds of thousands of users to an opt-in model with an automated monitoring and rollback system triggered in the event customer behavior regression was detected.
- Built a resource auditor which identified $1M ARR in leaked resources. Designed a cleanup mechanism to release unused resources while guaranteeing 100% safety to inflight production workflows.
