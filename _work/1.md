Abstract: As the usage of intelligent agents increases, understanding end-user perceptions becomes necessary to enhance human-computer interactions. While perceived anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence have been studied previously, there has not been any direct research showing the effect perceived anthropomorphism has on the end-user’s perception of intelligence. The focus of this paper is to measure how the perceived intelligence of an intelligent agent changes due to different levels of congruency between the agent and the human category schema. The results of this proposed research could help designers choose anthropomorphic features that can increase users’ perceived intelligence of intelligent agents.
