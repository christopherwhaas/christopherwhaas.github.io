        <p class="col-12 col-md-11 text-center">
            The price of a <strong>leaf</strong> will flucuate from season to season. This is largely due to the fact that ads served by Google's AdMob vary in cost per impression (CPM).
             Everytime a <strong>leafr</strong> collects a <strong>leaf</strong>, a banner or video ad is displayed, and that ad will have a certain CPM. This also means that any <strong>leaves</strong> earned without watching
             ads will cause the price of a <strong>leaf</strong> to deflate. meaning if you intentionally avoid ads, then you are hurting the donating power of other <strong>leafrs</strong> in that season.
              
             <br><em>Please do not intentionally avoid the ads, this is how leafr donates to a cause.</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Ad Revenue will be split <em>60-40</em>, where 60% will be donated to the Season's Cause, and 40% will go towards the continued
             development of the <strong>leafr</strong> app. 
            This development costs will pay for the third-party storage, hosting, and bandwidth fees, and any remaining balance will pay my salary.
            <br>
            <br>
            This app was built entirely by <a href={{"/" | relative_url }} target="_blank">myself</a> as a passion project, and I would love to 
            continue building it into something that makes a tangible change in the world. However, app development is very time 
            consuming and I'll need to pay the bills somehow. This will be a learning process, and as <strong>leafr</strong> grows, so will this formula, and once I reach an amount that I
            am able to properly work off of, I will cap my salary and only the percentage towards the season's cause will grow. <em>I will be transparent with any and all ad revenue throughout the process by uploading receipts and screenshots of all transactions.</em> 
            Check back here and on the <a href={{"/leafr/seasons" | relative_url}} >Seasons</a> page to see proof of transactions and to monitor <strong>leafr's</strong> impact on the world.
