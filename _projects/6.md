MIXR is an iOS app that is used for curating music for a group of music enthusiasts. If you have ever had difficulty selecting a Spotify playlist that everyone in your group agrees with, MIXR can help. 

Our team created this app through the use of Spotify's recommendation API to generate a playlist based on a group of users' added tracks. Users also have the ability to export generated playlists to their Spotify account. Our team also utilized Firebase to store the user's previously generated playlist data.
